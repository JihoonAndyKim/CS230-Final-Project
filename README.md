Fashion deep learning with CycleGANs

Contained in our repo is the code for the PyTorch CycleGAN implementation. Ideas for this code were borrowed
from Jun-Yan Zhu located at https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix and from Hardik Bansal
located at https://hardikbansal.github.io/CycleGANBlog/

Files in the repository:

model.py - Contains the generator and discriminator architecture, written by Miguel Ferrer Avila

train.py - Performs the training regime, written by Miguel Ferrer Avila

iotools.py - Helper functions to help with the input and output of the code as used by Jun-Yan Zhu

plotLoss.py - Plotting script to plot losses

getImages.py - Image scraper tool, written by Andy Kim

URLS - URLs containing the images for training

Data - Directory of images for training

checkpoints - Directory to store results from training (Auto-generated by code)

images - Directory to store the results from testing the model (Auto-generated by code)

# To Start:
-python packages "pytorch", "numpy", "PIL" and "torchvision" must be installed

-Place data in Data folder with training images in trainA, trainB. Place test images in testA, testB. These images correspond to the domain they represent.

-run "python train,py"
